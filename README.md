# CSSWizard
This cut lil' application has some big dreams. Its ultimate goal is allowing you to mass modify the colour scheme of any CSS file you throw at it. Inspired by [SemanticUI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) and their unwillingness to add an official dark theme.

## Feature list:
- [x] Flip brightness of all colours
- [ ] Change brightness of all colours
- [ ] Change hue of all colours
- [ ] Change saturation of all colours
